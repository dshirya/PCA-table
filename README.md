## Introduction 

* **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis): Simplifies your data by reducing its dimensions while keeping the most important information
* **PLS-DA** (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis): A classification method that can help distinguish between different groups in your data.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:
* Python 3.9 or later (If you don’t have it, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org))
* Jupyter Lab (An interactive development environment for notebooks)
* Git (Optional, if you want to clone the repository, otherwise you can download the ZIP file)
* A modern web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)

## Installation Steps

1. **Install Python**
* Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org). Follow the installer instructions for your operating system.
2. **Install Jupyter Lab**
* Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and type the following command:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
  
3. **Download or Clone the Project**
*  Option 1: Download ZIP  
Download the project as a ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a folder on your computer.

* Option 2: Clone with Git  
If you have Git installed, open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dshirya/pca-plsda-activity/tree/main
```
4. **Install Required Libraries**
* Navigate to your project folder in the terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project-folder
```
* Install all necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

Once everything is installed, follow these steps to run the project:
1.	Start Jupyter Lab: 
In the terminal, make sure you are in the project folder and run:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
A web browser window will open showing the Jupyter Lab interface.

2.	Open the Notebook:  
In Jupyter Lab, locate and click on the notebook file (it will have the .ipynb extension).
3.	Run the Code Cells:  
You can run each cell by clicking on it and pressing **Shift + Enter** or by clicking the “Run” button. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform PCA and PLS-DA analyses.
